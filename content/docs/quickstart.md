## Hardware requirements

The pipeline assumes one specific shape: NVIDIA GPU + recent CUDA/Vulkan +
modern x86 Linux. There is no CPU fallback for video decode/inference.

Tested target:

- AMD Ryzen 9 9900X
- NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super (16 GB VRAM)
- Arch Linux

Other Linux distributions with the same component versions should work.

## System dependencies

Arch package names — translate as appropriate for your distribution.

```bash
# Core
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake clang pkgconf
sudo pacman -S --needed cuda cudnn          # NVDEC + CUDA EP
sudo pacman -S --needed vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader
                                            # Vulkan compute (whisper.cpp backend)
sudo pacman -S --needed ffmpeg              # 8.x with --enable-nvdec --enable-nvenc
sudo pacman -S --needed espeak-ng           # only for the test fixture
```

You do **not** need TensorRT installed. The ONNX Runtime TensorRT EP registers
with bowdler but falls through to the CUDA EP if `libnvinfer.so` is missing.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release --workspace
```

Cold builds compile a lot (RocksDB, whisper.cpp, ffmpeg-sys-next, ort) — budget
~10 minutes the first time. Incremental builds are seconds.

## Models

Both models are runtime downloads — they are not vendored in the repo. The easy
path is one command:

```bash
bowdler models download                          # NudeNet + whisper-medium.en
bowdler models download --whisper-variant tiny.en
bowdler models download --no-audio               # vision only
bowdler models download --force                  # re-fetch even if present
```

Both models land in `~/.cache/bowdler/models/`. Existing files are skipped
unless `--force` is given (NudeNet is hash-checked against its pinned sha256).
The subcommand needs `uv` and `curl` on `$PATH`.

### NudeNet 320n — manual fallback

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cache/bowdler/models
uv venv /tmp/nn && uv pip install --python /tmp/nn/bin/python nudenet
cp /tmp/nn/lib/python*/site-packages/nudenet/320n.onnx \
   ~/.cache/bowdler/models/nudenet-320n.onnx
rm -rf /tmp/nn
```

Pinned: nudenet 3.4.2's bundled `320n.onnx`,
sha256 `c15d8273adad2d0a92f014cc69ab2d6c311a06777a55545f2c4eb46f51911f0f`.

### Whisper — manual fallback

```bash
curl -L -o ~/.cache/bowdler/models/whisper-medium.en.bin \
  https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.en.bin
```

For testing or low-VRAM systems, swap `medium` for `tiny`.

## Your first cut

```bash
bowdler run movie.mkv -o movie.bowdler.mkv
```

That's the one-shot path: detect → auto-approve high-confidence detections →
render. If you'd rather review every detection by hand, use the three-step
workflow on the [CLI reference]({{< relref "cli" >}}) page.
